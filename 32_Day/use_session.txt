Using session in views
    - When SessionMiddleware is activated, each HttpRequest object, the first argument to any Django view function will have a session attribute,which is a dictionary like object. 
    - Session data is stored in the database, and is available on every request.

    - Set Item
        request.session['key'] = 'value'
    
    - get Item 
        returned_value = request.session['key']

    - Delete item 
        del request.session['key']
        This raises KeyError if the given key isn't already in the session.

    - Contains
        'key' in request.session
