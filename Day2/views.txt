urls are responsible for finding or locating the resource and the action 
that should be triggered are called Views

The logic that is executed for different URLs (and HTTP methods)

Logic can be written in 
    --- Function 
    --- Class
            ----- Code that handles (evaluates) requests and returns Response

    -- loading and prepare data
    -- Run any other bussiness logic 
    -- Prepare and return  response data ( html)




while making a views you need to write a Function to write a bussiness logic or view angainst that URLs that will be hitted
each view or function take a request parameter return a http response

from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello world)

view has been defined now, we need to define the logic when it should be called. definelty through urls
create a urls file

import django.url import path
urlpatterns = [
    path(")
]

    --------->>>>>>-----Requests---------->>>>-----------|
User                                                        Server (Server Database)
    ---------<<<<<<-----Response----------<<<<-----------|


Views are responsible for processing requests ( parsing the URL, Http method and potential reuqests data ) and creating a response
